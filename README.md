Project Name: Puppy Resturant
Project Description: We recreated a website based on a figma.
Note: Desktop is optimized for 1920x1200. I hope.....
Peer Reviewer: Elizabeth Trotter
Peer Review: Your website overall looks close to the desktop prototype. The responsiveness is not too bad, a very good effort! Taking into consideration the deadline for this project, I have just a couple of quick fixes I think you should add: change the title in the head for the Menu and Catering pages from the default "Bootstrap demo" and make the footer on the Catering page the same as the others to show a bit more consistency. Thanks for letting me peer review your site!
